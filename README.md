Determinants of Consumer Satisfaction of Mobile Banking Services: Focusing on Computational User Experience with Online Reviews

This study analyzed the determinants of mobile banking service satisfaction based on user experience and online reviews. Accordingly, four commercial banks in the United States that provide mobile banking services were selected as analysis subjects, and a total of 149,761 user ratings and reviews were collected to be analyzed. User experience factors were used as potential determinants based on previous studies, and well-known text mining techniques – the bag-of-words model and sentiment analysis – were used for extracting the factors. A multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the effects of the extracted user experience factors on satisfaction (user rating), and the effects of the factors extracted by two techniques on satisfaction are quantitatively proposed. In the bag-of-words approach,  affection was confirmed to be the major determinant, while in the sentiment analysis,  hedonic value was confirmed to be the major determinant. The effects of user experience factors on satisfaction varied depending on the extent of users’ expression (review length) regarding the service.
